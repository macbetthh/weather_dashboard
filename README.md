# Weather Dashboard

## Description

In this Bootcamp challenge, I was reqauired to create a weather dashboard that allows users to search for a city's current weather and a 5-day forecast. It includes displaying weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a search history feature.

## Features

- Search form to find weather data for a city
- Current weather display including city name, date, weather condition icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed
- 5-day weather forecast with date, weather condition icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity
- Search history stored in localStorage with clickable entries to reload weather data for previously searched cities

## Usage

[Click here to navigate to the deployed page](https://macbetthh.github.io/weather_dashboard/)

- Enter a city name in the search form to view current weather and a 5-day forecast.
- Click on a city in the search history to reload its weather data.
